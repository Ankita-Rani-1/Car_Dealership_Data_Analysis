# Car_Dealership_Data_Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of car sales using SQL queries. The dataset is stored in a MySQL database named 'cars' with a table called 'car_dekho'.

## Database Setup
1. `Create the database:`
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE cars;
 `USE cars;`

# Queries and Analysis
The project includes various SQL queries to extract insights from the car sales data:

1.Total number of cars in the dataset.<br>
2.Number of cars available in specific years (2023, 2020, 2021, 2022).<br>
3.Grouping of car counts by year.<br>
4.Analysis of car types by fuel (Diesel, Petrol, CNG) for different years.<br>
5.Identification of years with more than 100 cars.<br>
6.Detailed car information for the years 2015-2023.<br>

# Key Findings

1.The dataset contains information about car sales across multiple years.<br>
2.Analyses include yearly trends, fuel type distributions, and specific year focuses.<br>
3.Custom queries allow for flexible data exploration based on different criteria.<br>

# How to Use

1.Set up a MySQL database and import the 'car_dekho' table data.<br>
2.Run the provided SQL queries to perform various analyses.<br>
3.Modify queries as needed for additional insights.<br>

# Future Improvements

1.Add data visualization components.<br>
2.Implement more complex statistical analyses.<br>
3.Create a user interface for easier query execution and result viewing.<br>
